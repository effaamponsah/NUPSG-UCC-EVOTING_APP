Please follow the instructions below to successfully install and run the application.


The instructions are devided into two sections.


Initial Steps
NB::The intial step must be done only once.

1. Please download and install python3 if you dont not have it on the system.
During the installation phase, add the path to environmental path.

2. Connect to the internet open the project folder, open command prompt in the folder.

3. In the terminal, type 'python3 install -r requirements.txt'. This will install the dependencies 
 needed to run the project.

4. After the step 3 installs the depencies, open WAMPSERVER and create a database called 'nupsg'.
 You can disconnect your internet.

5. Open command prompt in the folder 'setup' and type 'python3 createtables.py'

6. Open the file 'fillme.py' inside the 'setup' folder and read the instructions in there to insert the names of the 
 cadidates.

7. Type 'python3 fillme.py' in the 'setup' folder as you did in 5.

8. Place all images of the candidates into static folder. Each with a unique and simple name. 
Example:: Presidential candidates can have the names as 'ps1.jpg' and 'ps2.jpg'.

9. Open 'data.json' file inside the 'seed' folder. Under each position add the names of the images into the
 images space provided. Make sure the image file name matches the names of the candidates. Take a look at 'sample_data.json'
file if you are confused.






Final Steps.
1. To start the application, ensure that all the steps above have been done.

2. In the folder of the project, type 'python3 app.py' in command prompt.

3. Open your browser and type 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin'. This takes you to the admin page. Here we will have to add a 
student since we don't have any student at the moment.
NB::The admin page must be seen by only you guys. not the students.

4. After adding the user, you can test the user by opening 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' and logging in with the index number provided.


5. To view the resutls after voting type 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/results'. This takes you to the page.

 to the db. The students can now vote


8. Connect to a network(internet is not necessary).
Navigate back to the project root and open 'app.py' file. On the end of the file where you see 'app.run()',
Change it to 'app.run(host='ip_address')' where ip_address is the ip address of the host computer.
Connect other computers to the network as well and enter your ip_address in their browser. They should be able to 
vote as well.
